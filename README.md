# Drupal 8: Community Ready
A Drupal 8 retrospective, personal story, and thoughts. A reveal.js presentation.

## Summary

Drupal 8 isn't just a new version of Drupal, it's a change in how we approach coding and community.

Over the last few years, we've overcame Not-Invented-Here Syndrome. We've embraced new technologies and new approaches to writing code. We've shortened our release cycles to bring fixes and new features into Drupal faster than ever before. During this monumental effort, we've also endured burnout, taught ourselves new ways of doing things, all while confronting single, a daunting goal. Where do we go from here?

Drupal 8 enables us leave our island and sail the greater PHP seas. There's never been a better time to join us on our voyage.

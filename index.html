        <h1>Drupal at a Crossroads</h1>
        <aside class="notes">
          In many ways, Drupal today is at a kind of crossroads. There's been
          a lot of speculation, hope, excitement, even a little fear. Developers
          and businesses alike have a lot to be both concerned, and excited about.

        <h2>Huge Changes</h2>
        <p class="fragment">In code and process</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          There's been some huge changes with over the last several years.
          Critics have called Drupal 8 a completely different CMS from the
          previous version. While intimidating, there were many changes we
          needed for Drupal to be ready for the now and the future.

        <h2>Gigantic Dev Cycle</h2>
        <p class="fragment">4 years!</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          There's also been a gigantic development cycle for this version,
          longer than any other we've done in the history of the project. Four
          years! That's an eternity in the tech world.

        <h2>"When it's Ready"</h2>
        <p>Led to speculation, worry</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          We also had the nagging problem that we never really knew when Drupal
          8 was going to be released. We said, "When it's ready". This created
          a lot of speculation and even worry that Drupal would never get out
          the door.

        <h2>Community Shakeup</h2>
        <p>Long time devs left or reduced involvement</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          We've also had some long time developers leave the project, or reduce
          their involvement. From an outsider perspective it's hard to read this
          in an alarming way, forgetting about the many new developers that have
          joined the project recently and had a big impact.

          first, but it was certainly the highest profile.

        <aside class="notes">
          Drupal 7 is, to me, full of anachronisms. It's composed of straight
          functions -- mostly. There isn't anything wrong with that, it only
          feels...well...old fashioned. It was also justified in Drupal's case
          as PHP 4's OOP support was odd and incomplete.

        <h2>Hooks are API Go-Fish</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          The thing that really bothered me was hooks, hooks are like API
          Go-fish.  I had been coding for over a decade at that point. I've been
          through 4 years of college, worked in multiple languages and products,
          and I had never saw anything like hooks. Drupal 7, in essence, asks each
          module "Do you have a something-hook?" and if it does, it executes it.
          I just couldn't believe the project I had come to love the last few
          years works like that. I was dumbfounded.

          With the exception of the database layer, there were huge arrays of
          doom everywhere in Drupal. Either you needed to create them in your
          code, or work with huge, undocumentable monstrosities that you needed
          to run through a debugger first BEFORE writing your code. WTH!?

          Drupal 7 was also built with the assumption of the desktop web at its
          core. When a request comes in, Drupal processes it, routes it to the
          appropriate handlers, and then returns HTML for display. With frameworks
          like React and mobile applications, the need to return HTML has gotten
          smaller and smaller.

          what's easy and fun, vs. the most critical changes we need to make.

          Incrementally updating a large software project like Drupal is difficult
          in practice. Work isn't really really reduced, only the perception of
          how much work there is.

          One of the first things I think we could do better in the future, and

        <h2>Drupal 8 Created a lot of FUD</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          Drupal 8 created a lot of FUD. Any popular project that undergoes a
          big refactoring as Drupal did inevitability results in FUD. Our seemingly
          never-ending development cycle helped little, but that wasn't all.

      <section>
        <h2>FUD easily created Unintentionally</h2>
        <p>Social media echo chamber</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          FUD is easily created unintentionally, especially in Open Source. With
          so many voices from so many backgrounds it's easy for any irregularity,
          difference of opinion, or unexpected delay to result in fear,
          uncertainty and doubt.

          This is amplified by the social media echo chamber where concerns can
          be reposted spread virally in seconds.

        <aside class="notes">
          Drupal 8 had several people either leaving the project entirely or
          taking on reduced roles. When this happens in the middle of a dev
          cycle, it can be seen as a sign the project is failing.

          We've also had some other missteps that created FUD. Sequestering
          core developers for dedicated, private sprinting and other "heads
          down" behavior may be forgotten now, but it was a serious worry that
          created a needless information vacuum in which FUD can flourish.

        <p class="fragment">Larger projects, sponsoring corporation or foundation</p>
        <aside class="notes">
          This isn't easy in open source! Often it requires a single point of
          communication. In smaller projects this is often the lead developer
          or original author. With a project as large as Drupal, it usually
          falls to the sponsoring corporation, foundation, or association.

        <aside class="notes">
          This isn't an easy job either, and it is a job. Providing clear and
          consistent communication throughout a development cycle is demanding.
          If it doesn't come from an authoritative source, it won't have clout
          to fight fear, uncertainty and doubt. I like calling this role the
          "Contrib Champion" others call it a "Core Ombudsman". No matter
          what they're called, I think it's an essential piece for Drupal's
          future success.

        <h2>BURNOUT</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          For four years we worked on Drupal 8. While I didn't spend a lot of
          time with core, I did put a lot of effort into developing one of the
          first Drupal 8 modules. And I have to tell you, it was exhausting.
          Today more than one developer in Drupal is suffering from a psychological
          and physiological condition known as burnout.

        <h2>What Causes Burnout?</h2>
        <blockquote class="fragment">
          The candle the burns twice as bright burns half as long.
        </blockquote>
        <aside class="notes">
          While I can go into a long description of burnout and what causes it,
          I find the following quote a great summary. 'The candle that burns
          twice as bright burns half as long.' This is from the film Blade Runner.

          Like many coders, we in Drupal often enjoy working on Drupal both as
          a day job and as something fun to do. More than one developer working
          on Drupal 8 was caught up in this pattern. For a short period of time,
          this is okay, but four years is a very, very long time.

          A few developers I've spoken to have suffered burnout during Drupal 8's
          development cycle. Solutions are often very personal, but some patterns
          exist. We can reduce the risk of burning out by...doing less. This
          seems obvious, but it can be very, very difficult to do. We're passionate
          in the Drupal community, but we can't subsist on passion alone.

        <h1>Drupal at a Crossroads</h1>
        <aside>
          In many ways, Drupal today is at a kind of crossroads. There's been
          a lot of speculation, hope, excitement, even a little fear. Developers
          and businesses alike have a lot to be both concerned, and excited about.

        <h2>Huge Changes</h2>
        <p class="fragment">That we really needed</p>
        <aside>
          There's been some huge changes with over the last several years.
          Critics have called Drupal 8 a completely different CMS from the
          previous version. While intimidating, there were many changes we
          needed for Drupal to be ready for the now and the future.

        <h2>Gigantic Dev Cycle</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Four years!</p>
        <aside>
          There's also been a gigantic development cycle for this version,
          longer than any other we've done in the history of the project. Four
          years! That's an eternity in the tech world.
        </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>"When it's Ready"</h2>
        <p>Led to speculation, worry</p>
        <aside>
          We also had the nagging problem that we never really knew when Drupal
          8 was going to be released. We said, "When it's ready". This created
          a lot of speculation and even worry that Drupal would never get out
          the door.

        <p>Long time devs left or reduced involvement</p>
        <p>While others joined the project</p>
        <aside>
          We've also had some long time developers leave the project, or reduce
          their involvement. From an outsider perspective it's hard to read this
          in an alarming way, forgetting about the many new developers that have
          joined the project recently and had a big impact.

        <p>Not the first, but highest profile</p>
        <aside>
          And let's not forget the big fork Drupal had recently. It wasn't the
          first, but it was certainly the highest profile.

          A lot of this seems like it's all just too much. That Drupal 8 feels
          too different. Yet, change can be a very, very good thing.

          a talk an "Musical CMS: How Symfony is coming to Drupal".
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <aside>
          This was my second Drupal camp. I actually had given a talk just the
          previous day on how does Drupal 7 work. See, for year's I had used
          Drupal for my own site, but I never really developed any code for it,
          nor peaked inside core. I decided to change that. I set up a debugger
          and stepped through the entire Drupal 7 init process. And that's when
          I discovered something kinda surprising.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Drupal 7 is <u>weird</u></h2>
        <aside>
          Drupal 7 is really, really weird. While I had largely taught myself
          coding, I had done so in C++. From there I learned several other
          languages then finally PHP. And D7 didn't look like anything I had
          come to expect.

        <h2>Anachronisms</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Straight functions (mostly)</p>
        <p class="fragment">PHP4's OOP was odd &amp; incomplete</p>
        <aside>
          Drupal 7 is, to me, full of anachronisms. It's composed of straight
          functions -- mostly. There isn't anything wrong with that, it only
          feels...well...old fashioned. It was also justified in Drupal's case
          as PHP 4's OOP support was odd and incomplete.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Hooks are API Go-Fish</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Do you have a _____ hook?</p>
        <aside>
          The thing that really bothered me was hooks, hooks are like API
          Go-fish.  I had been coding for over a decade at that point. I've been
          through 4 years of college, worked in multiple languages and products,
          and I had never saw anything like hooks. Drupal 7, in essence, asks each
          module "Do you have a something-hook?" and if it does, it executes it.
          I just couldn't believe the project I had come to love the last few
          years works like that. I was dumbfounded.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Code for everything!</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Even for things that shouldn't be code</p>
        <aside>
          That wasn't the only thing that bothered me. Drupal used code for
          everything. Menu items, forms, and tons of other things that shouldn't
          be code. I did't understand why we didn't save these in flat-files
          like many, many other projects.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Arrays of doom!</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Undocumentable monstrosities</p>
        <aside>
          With the exception of the database layer, there were huge arrays of
          doom everywhere in Drupal. Either you needed to create them in your
          code, or work with huge, undocumentable monstrosities that you needed
          to run through a debugger first BEFORE writing your code. WTH!?
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <img alt="Request, process, return HTML"/>
        <aside>
          Drupal 7 was also built with the assumption of the desktop web at its
          core. When a request comes in, Drupal processes it, routes it to the
          appropriate handlers, and then returns HTML for display. With frameworks
          like React and mobile applications, the need to return HTML has gotten
          smaller and smaller.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Bootstrapping Drupal is slow!</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Everything is loaded even when not needed</p>
        <aside>
          drupal_bootstrap() is also really slow! Even if Drupal 7 was returning
          a REST response, it would still load the theme layer, load up all
          modules, and require a lot of CPU and memory resources. This makes
          Drupal 7 unattractive as a backend to decoupled and native applications.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Not-Invented-Here (NIH)</h2>
        <p class="fragment">PHP4 dependencies were copy-paste</p>
        <p class="fragment">Drupal 7 didn't make this easier</p>
        <aside>
          Drupal also has a bad habit of developing their own solutions rather
          than working with others'. This is the "Not Invented Here" problem.

          In earlier versions of PHP, there was a good reason for this as
          including external dependencies was laborious. We literally had to
          copy and paste code into our repository. Today, however, there
          are many excellent libaries and tools we could leverage, yet Drupal
          7 did not provide any natural way to do so.
        </aside>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>NIH has a social cost</h2>
        <p>In-community preferred despite costs</p>
        <p>Sunk-cost fallacy makes replacement impossible</p>
        <aside>
          Not-invented-here also has a big social cost. It creates a culture
          where in-community solutions are immediately preferred even in the
          face of time, stress, and maintainership costs. Once in place,
          NIH motivated code can become impossible to replace due to the
          sunk-cost fallacy.

      <section>
        <h2>Sunk-cost Fallacy</h2>
        <p class="fragment">"Point of no return" thinking</p>
        <p class="fragment">Works in software design too</p>
        <aside>
          Haven't heard of the Sunk-cost Fallacy? It's an idea from behavioral
          economics that suggests once we've invested a certain amount of utility
          in something, we pass a point of "no return" where we're obligated
          to stick with it even when we know the problems.

          Usually this refers to cars, houses, movie or concert tickets, but it
          works in software design as well! Often, it's a key motivator behind
          forks.

        <img alt="Sad developer" />
        <aside>
          After discovering all of this, I was really discouraged. The coding
          techniques I had been familiar with for years just didn't apply to
          Drupal. It all seemed too strange, too weird, and too impenetrable for
          me to even seriously consider writing a module or contributing to core.

          The thing was, I had assumed I was alone. That no one else had this bizarre
          perspective on our beloved CMS. That is, until I was sitting in that
          auditorium listening to Crell talk about putting Symfony in Drupal.
          And then I got really, really excited.

        <aside>
          The first thing was that we finally started using object-oriented
          programming. PHP 5 brought a full OOP features that we could finally
          leverage in Drupal.

        <p class="fragment">Encapsulation</p>
        <aside>
          OOP brings more than just classes and objects, it standardizes error
          handling, provides a language consistent way to extend existing code,
          and compartmentalizes functionality making it easier to find what
          you need.

        <aside>
          One of the benefits of modern OOP is that it reduces "Drupalisms",
          of which hooks was one of the biggest offenders. These project-
          specific patterns have long been a barrier to developers that would
          otherwise look to other CMSes.

          OOP and reduced Drupalisms benefits longtime Drupal developers too.
          Drupal 8 provides a familiar environment to develop a broader base of
          skills.

          There are always technical things we could have done better. We could
          have chosen a different routing system, a different front end...and
          while those things are important, they're the least important
          things we should improve.

        <aside>
          One of the first things I think we could do better in the future, and
          I admit, also a personal axe to grind, is FUD. Fear Uncertainty, and Doubt.

        <h2>FUD easily created Unintentionally</h2>
        <p>Social media echo chamber</p>
        <aside>
          FUD is easily created unintentionally, especially in Open Source. With
          so many voices from so many backgrounds it's easy for any irregularity,
          difference of opinion, or unexpected delay to result in fear,
          uncertainty and doubt.

          This is amplified by the social media echo chamber where concerns can
          be reposted spread virally in seconds.

        <h2>Drupal 8 Created a lot of FUD</h2>
        <aside>
          Drupal 8 created a lot of FUD. Any popular project that undergoes a
          big refactoring as Drupal did inevitability results in FUD. Our seemingly
          never-ending development cycle helped little, but that wasn't all.

        <aside>
          Drupal 8 had several people either leaving the project entirely or
          taking on reduced roles. When this happens in the middle of a dev
          cycle, it can be seen as a sign the project is failing.

        <p>"Secret" sprints & "heads down" behavior</p>
        <aside>
          We've also had some other missteps that created FUD. Sequestering
          core developers for dedicated, private sprinting and other "heads
          down" behavior may be forgotten now, but it was a serious worry that
          created a needless information vacuum in which FUD can flourish.

        <h2>Fighting FUD</h2>

        <aside>
          So how can we fight FUD in when we start working on the next version
          of Drupal? We need clear, and consistent communication.

        <h2>Not easy in OSS</h2>
        <p class="fragment">For smaller projects, the lead dev or original author</p>
        <p class="fragment">Larger projects, sponsoring corporation or foundation</p>
        <aside>
          This isn't easy in open source! Often it requires a single point of
          communication. In smaller projects this is often the lead developer
          or original author. With a project as large as Drupal, it usually
          falls to the sponsoring corporation, foundation, or association.

        <h2>Not an easy Job</h2>
        <p class="fragment">And it is a job.</p>
        <p class="fragment">"Contrib Champion", "Core Ombudsman"</p>
        <aside>
          This isn't an easy job either, and it is a job. Providing clear and
          consistent communication throughout a development cycle is demanding.
          If it doesn't come from an authoritative source, it won't have clout
          to fight fear, uncertainty and doubt. I like calling this role the
          "Contrib Champion" others call it a "Core Ombudsman". No matter
          what they're called, I think it's an essential piece for Drupal's
          future success.

        <h2>BURNOUT</h2>
        <aside>
          For four years we worked on Drupal 8. While I didn't spend a lot of
          time with core, I did put a lot of effort into developing one of the
          first Drupal 8 modules. And I have to tell you, it was exhausting.
          Today more than one developer in Drupal is suffering from a psychological
          and physiological condition known as burnout.

        </blockquote>
        <aside>
          While I can go into a long description of burnout and what causes it,
          I find the following quote a great summary. 'The candle that burns
          twice as bright burns half as long.' This is from the film Blade Runner.

          Like many coders, we in Drupal often enjoy working on Drupal both as
          a day job and as something fun to do. More than one developer working
          on Drupal 8 was caught up in this pattern. For a short period of time,
          this is okay, but four years is a very, very long time.

        <h2>Reducing Your Burnout Risk</h2>
        <p class="fragment">Do...less.</p>
        <aside>
          A few developers I've spoken to have suffered burnout during Drupal 8's
          development cycle. Solutions are often very personal, but some patterns
          exist. We can reduce the risk of burning out by...doing less. This
          seems obvious, but it can be very, very difficult to do. We're passionate
          in the Drupal community, but we can't subsist on passion alone.
